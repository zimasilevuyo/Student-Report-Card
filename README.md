# About this project

    This program named- “Report Card Management System”, aims at helping teachers and students to work with report cards in an organized manner. It makes provisions for adding, deleting, displaying and various other functions on student records. All the records are saved to data files.
    The program has three access levels- Teacher, Student and Public. The Teacher function (accessed by a password) has administrator rights over the records and can manipulate the records in any way. The Student and Public are restricted to the viewership of the records and statistical analysis.

    Note:
    This project was developed for Windows systems using the Dev C++ IDE
    Record.dat contains sample student records
    The password to the Teacher is- ADCDEF
    The secure code for each student is accessed by displaying all the records with Teacher privileges
    Use a window size of 80x25 for the optimal viewing experience
    Compiled using the mingw32-gcc-g++ compiler- Version 6.3.0-1
